What is this?
-------------

Metagoofil is a tool for extracting metadata of public documents (pdf,doc,xls,ppt,etc) availables in the target websites. This information could be useful because you can get valid usernames, people names, for using later in bruteforce password attacks (vpn, ftp, webapps), the tool will also extracts interesting "paths" of the documents, where we can get shared resources names, server names, etc.

Metagoodil Selenium uses Selenium to perform the google search. This can lead to user interaction in case of captchas.

How it works?
------------

The tool first opens a webbrowser. Then it performs a query in Google requesting different filetypes that can have useful metadata (pdf, doc, xls,ppt,etc), then will download those documents to the disk and extracts the metadata of the file using specific libraries for parsing different file types (Hachoir, Pdfminer, etc)

------------
